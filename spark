To enrich the user events table with information from the bot lookup using PySpark, you can follow these steps. Make sure you have PySpark installed and set up properly.

Import Required Libraries and Initialize a SparkSession:

Start by importing the necessary PySpark libraries and initializing a SparkSession.

Load Dataframes:

Load the user events, user sessions, and bot lookup data as DataFrames.

bot_lookup_df = spark.read.csv("bot_lookup.tsv", sep="\t", header=True, inferSchema=True)

Join DataFrames:

Join the user events DataFrame with the user sessions DataFrame to identify the groups of user_identifier with user_session.

Enrich with Bot Info:

Now, use the bot lookup DataFrame to assign each user_identifier with either "user" or "bot" to the rows based on the correct date.

In this code, we're joining the DataFrames based on matching user_identifier and session_date columns and selecting the inferred_bot_status from the bot_lookup_df.

Save the Enriched Data:

saved the enriched DataFrame to a new CSV file or any other desired output format.

Stop Spark Session:

Finally, stop the Spark session when you're done.
