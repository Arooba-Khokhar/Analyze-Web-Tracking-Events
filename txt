This code performs the following steps:

Loads the web tracking events data from a CSV file into a pandas DataFrame (assuming the file is named 'web_tracking_events.csv').

Filters the DataFrame to include only successful trace events where the status is 200.

Extracts the utm_source information from the 'url' column using regular expressions and creates a new 'utm_source' column.

Replaces null or empty utm_source values with "unknown".

Filters the DataFrame to include only rows where the 'page_type' is 'pageimpression', and then calculates the top 5 utm_source values by count.

Finally, it prints the top 5 utm_source values based on the count of 'page_type=pageimpression'.

Make sure to replace 'web_tracking_events.csv' with the actual file path to your CSV file containing web tracking events data.
